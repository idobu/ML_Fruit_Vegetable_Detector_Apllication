# ML_Fruit_Vegetable_Detector_Apllication
A Smartphone Application that uses ML to identify 15 types of fruits &amp; vegetables

ML project using React Native, Python and NodeJS. 
The React-Native app sends request (with a picture that is sent to the server as part of the request) to the NodeJS server to run (using "PythonShell") the prediction script in python.

Front: React-Native
Back: NodeJS 
ML: Training and making Predictions with Python script using tensorflow & keras (Neural Networks)
Emulator: Android Studio
Data: collected from picture dataset site https://www.kaggle.com/

The React Native app runs with npm and the NodeJS server runs with VS.
(can run on IOS and Android)

notes:
* the dataset is too heavy and will not be included...., but the trained model is inside :)
* the App.tsx -> React native running using npm
* the server.js -> NodeJS runnin using VS
* front & back written using TypeScript
